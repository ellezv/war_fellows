Drafting fellow Code Fellows fellows to war.

Driver: Britt

Navigators: Britney and Fiona


### Backstory

Our team was given the name War by Sam. Pretty early on, we realized that if we were war, then we would need to draft more than three folks onto our war team. So we created a draft.

Our goal is to draft fellow Code Fellows fellows to our war team based on the attributes we think would be fitting for our team.

### Problem Domain

To make the draft most effective, we will create a search component that will give us the ability to search by name, programming language, specialty, etc. We also want to give users the ability to draft and remove individuals from their war team.

If given enough time, money, and manpower, we'd also like to provide graphs that break down the attributes of our chosen war team.
